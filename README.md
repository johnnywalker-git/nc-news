# NC News

A responsive React site for showing articles to a user.

A user can view all articles, filter articles by topic, or sort by date/popularity etc.

On the article page, a user can vote on an article, view comments of an article, and add their own comment.

It uses optimistic rendering to show updates straight away whilst a request to the server is taking place.


Installation:
Fork repo. 
run 'npm init i'.
run 'npm run dev'.

Stack:
Constructed with Vite.
Axios for API requests.
React router for routing.
Date-fns for more user-friendly dates.

## Lessons Learned

I learned about optimistic rendering, and routing in React.

In the future, I would like to add facilities to have a user sign in, profile etc. I would do this by using Context.
